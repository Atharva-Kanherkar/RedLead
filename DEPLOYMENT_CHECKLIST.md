## üîÑ 7. Post-Deployment

### Get Deployment URL
- [ ] Note your DigitalOcean URL: `https://redlead-backend-xxxxx.ondigitalocean.app`

### Update Backend URL References
- [ ] Update `BACKEND_URL` env var in DO dashboard
- [ ] Update `REDDIT_REDIRECT_URI` env var in DO dashboard
- [ ] Trigger redeployment

### Update External Services
- [ ] Reddit app: Update callback URL to DO URL
- [ ] Clerk dashboard: Update webhook endpoint to DO URL
- [ ] Frontend: Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to DO URL

### Verify Deployment
- [ ] Health check: `curl https://YOUR_URL/health` returns 200
- [ ] Ready check: `curl https://YOUR_URL/ready` returns "connected"
- [ ] HTTPS works (should have SSL automatically)
- [ ] CORS works (test from frontend)

---

## üß™ 8. Testing

### API Endpoints
- [ ] Can create account (sign up works)
- [ ] Can sign in (authentication works)
- [ ] Can create campaign (database writes work)
- [ ] Can analyze website (AI service works)
- [ ] Can connect Reddit (OAuth works)
- [ ] Can discover leads (Reddit API works)

### Background Jobs
- [ ] Check logs - cron jobs running
- [ ] Workers don't crash
- [ ] Database queries work
- [ ] No memory leaks

### Performance
- [ ] API responds < 500ms (avg)
- [ ] Database queries < 100ms (avg)
- [ ] No 500 errors in logs
- [ ] Memory usage stable

---

## üìä 9. Monitoring

### DigitalOcean Dashboard
- [ ] Set up alerts for:

  - High memory usage
- [ ] Check runtime logs regularly
- [ ] Monitor database connection count

### External Monitoring (Optional)
- [ ] Set up UptimeRobot or similar (free)
- [ ] Monitor `/health` endpoint every 5 minutes
- [ ] Email alerts on downtime

---

## üêõ 10. Rollback Plan

### If Deployment Fails
- [ ] Check deployment logs in DO dashboard
- [ ] Revert to previous deployment (DO keeps history)
- [ ] Check environment variables
- [ ] Verify external services (Neon, Clerk, Reddit)

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# In DigitalOcean dashboard:
# 1. Go to your app
# 2. Click "Deployments"
# 3. Find previous successful deployment
# 4. Click "Redeploy"
```

---

## üìù 11. Documentation

- [ ] Update README with production URLs
- [ ] Document any production-specific setup
- [ ] Share deployment guide with team
- [ ] Document troubleshooting steps

---

## ‚úÖ Final Verification

Before marking as "deployed":

```bash
# 1. Health check passes
curl https://YOUR_URL/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy",...}

# 2. Database connects
curl https://YOUR_URL/ready
# Returns: {"status":"ready","checks":{"database":"connected"}}

# 3. Authentication works
# Sign in from frontend, check network tab

# 4. Core features work
# Create campaign, discover leads, etc.

# 5. No errors in logs
# Check DigitalOcean runtime logs

# 6. Workers running
# Check logs for cron job messages
```

---

## üéâ Deployment Complete!

Once all checkboxes are ‚úÖ:

Your production URLs:
- **Backend**: `https://redlead-backend-xxxxx.ondigitalocean.app`
- **Frontend**: `https://red-lead.vercel.app`
- **Database**: Neon (managed)

Your app is now:
- ‚úÖ Secure
- ‚úÖ Scalable (up to ~1,000 users)
- ‚úÖ Monitored
- ‚úÖ Auto-deploying
- ‚úÖ Production-ready

---

**Estimated Total Time**: 30-60 minutes (if all credentials are ready)

**Cost**: $5/month to start
